# Spring-Community

This is a simple micro-service I built using Java and the Spring Boot Framework. I have used Java in many of my courses 
as I have worked to accomplish my Computer Science Degree. Java has always facinated me and I have really learned a lot 
about the nitty gritty of software development from learning Java development. I created this little application to connect
to a MySQL database as a way to learn and practice using the Spring Boot Framework. I like how simple it is to map Java 
Objects to entries in a relational database using the Spring Framework tools. I also used Maven to manage dependencies and 
learned a lot building this little application.
